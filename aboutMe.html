    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <p> My name is Maria McIntyre. I am a high school student at <a href="https://www.newtoncountryday.org/">Newton Country Day School</a>. In school I am learning computer programing using Code High School and other programing tools. <br>
      I am very interested in Computer Programing and Biology. My school is working on including many courses in computer science. For the next two years I hope to take AP computer science courses. </p>
     <p>In school I play basketball and tennis. During the fall and winter season I play tennis on a outside of school team. In the summer I work as a tennis instructor at our local tennis club. I do not play basketball outside of school but will play sometimes with my brother. Outside of school I enjoy hiking with my family and going to the beach. I have three siblings, two older brothers and one older sister. My two older brothers have both graduated college
      and my older sister graduated from high school. </p>
