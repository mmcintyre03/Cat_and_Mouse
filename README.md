This code was completed for Software Engineering CSCI 2113 at Geroge Washington University for Professor Kinga Dobolyi. This project created a point simulation of cats and mice. The cats will change the mice and eat them, but if a cat does not catch enough mice then they will pass away. The mice after a certain amount of rounds will also pass away. To complete this project object orientied programing was used to created multiple cats and mice.
